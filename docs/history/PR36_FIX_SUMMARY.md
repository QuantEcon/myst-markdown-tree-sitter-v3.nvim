# Fix for PR #36 Neovim Unresponsiveness Issue

## Problem Summary

PR #36 introduced changes that caused Neovim to become unresponsive when loading MyST markdown files. Users reported that Neovim would freeze, making it impossible to open the command palette, scroll, or enter commands.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by several problematic patterns introduced in PR #36:

1. **Blocking `vim.wait()` calls**: Multiple synchronous waits (10ms, 50ms, 100ms) that froze the UI thread
2. **Aggressive forced buffer reload**: `vim.cmd("edit!")` that could trigger cascading autocmds
3. **Complex retry mechanisms**: Nested refresh attempts that could create performance issues
4. **Excessive processing**: Multiple validation checks in tight loops

### Specific Problem Areas

- `refresh_highlighting()` function had multiple `vim.wait()` calls
- Forced buffer reload with `vim.cmd("edit!")` in line 179
- Complex retry logic in both `init.lua` and `ftdetect/myst.lua`
- Synchronous validation loops that blocked the main thread

## Solution

### Core Changes Made

1. **Replaced blocking operations**: All `vim.wait()` calls replaced with `vim.defer_fn()`
2. **Removed aggressive reload**: Eliminated `vim.cmd("edit!")` forced buffer reload
3. **Simplified retry logic**: Removed complex nested retry mechanisms
4. **Streamlined feedback**: Simplified enable/disable function feedback

### Key File Changes

#### `lua/myst-markdown/init.lua`
- Replaced `vim.wait(10)`, `vim.wait(50)`, `vim.wait(100)` with `vim.defer_fn()`
- Removed forced buffer reload section (lines 177-189 in original)
- Simplified `enable_myst()` and `disable_myst()` functions
- Updated `MystRefresh` command to use longer delay for status feedback

#### `ftdetect/myst.lua` 
- Removed complex retry logic that could cause cascading calls
- Simplified refresh mechanism to single attempt

### Technical Details

**Before (Problematic)**:
```lua
vim.wait(10) -- Blocks UI thread
-- ... more operations
vim.wait(50) -- Another block
-- ... validation
vim.cmd("edit!") -- Aggressive reload that triggers more autocmds
vim.wait(100) -- Final block
```

**After (Non-blocking)**:
```lua
vim.defer_fn(function()
  -- Asynchronous operation that doesn't block UI
  -- ... refresh logic
end, 20) -- Single async delay
```

## Validation

The fix includes comprehensive validation:

- ✅ No blocking `vim.wait()` function calls
- ✅ No aggressive `vim.cmd("edit!")` operations  
- ✅ Proper use of `vim.defer_fn()` for async operations
- ✅ Simplified retry logic to prevent cascading calls
- ✅ All operations are non-blocking

## Testing

Run the validation script to verify the fix:

```bash
./test/validate_pr36_fix.sh
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- ✅ Neovim remains responsive when opening MyST files
- ✅ No UI freezing or unresponsiveness
- ✅ MyST highlighting still works correctly
- ✅ Manual commands (:MystRefresh, :MystEnable, etc.) work smoothly
- ✅ No cascading autocmd triggers

## User Impact

- Users can now use the plugin without experiencing Neovim freezes
- All MyST highlighting functionality remains intact
- Manual commands provide appropriate feedback without blocking
- Plugin startup and file detection work smoothly

The fix maintains all the functionality improvements from PR #36 while eliminating the performance issues that caused unresponsiveness.
