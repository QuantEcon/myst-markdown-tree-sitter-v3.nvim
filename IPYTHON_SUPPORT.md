# IPython Synonym Support - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of ipython/ipython3 synonym support for python syntax highlighting.

## Problem Statement

The `tree-sitter-markdown` syntax highlighter was not recognizing `ipython` and `ipython3` as languages for syntax highlighting in MyST documents that work with Jupyter notebooks.

## Solution Implemented

Added support for `ipython` and `ipython3` as synonyms for `python` in MyST code-cell blocks only:
- `{code-cell} ipython` and `{code-cell} ipython3`

## Files Modified

### 1. `queries/myst/injections.scm`
Added 2 new injection patterns:
- `{code-cell} ipython` → injection.language "python"
- `{code-cell} ipython3` → injection.language "python"

### 2. `queries/markdown/injections.scm`
Added the same 2 injection patterns as above for consistency.

## Code Changes

### MyST Code-Cell Support
```tree-sitter
;; Inject Python parser into code-cell ipython blocks (synonym for python)
((fenced_code_block
  (info_string) @_lang
  (code_fence_content) @injection.content)
  (#eq? @_lang "{code-cell} ipython")
  (#set! injection.language "python"))

;; Inject Python parser into code-cell ipython3 blocks (synonym for python)
((fenced_code_block
  (info_string) @_lang
  (code_fence_content) @injection.content)
  (#eq? @_lang "{code-cell} ipython3")
  (#set! injection.language "python"))
```

## Usage Examples

### Before (No Syntax Highlighting)
````markdown
```{code-cell} ipython
import pandas as pd  # No syntax highlighting
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np   # No syntax highlighting
```
````

### After (Python Syntax Highlighting)
````markdown
```{code-cell} ipython
import pandas as pd  # ✓ Python syntax highlighting
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np   # ✓ Python syntax highlighting
```
````

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests to validate:
- Pattern detection in both injection files
- Correct mapping to "python" injection language
- Preservation of existing functionality
- All existing tests continue to pass

## Verification

- ✅ MyST code-cell ipython/ipython3 support
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Pattern ordering maintained
- ✅ Regular markdown blocks remain unaffected (preserves tree-sitter-markdown behavior)

## Impact

This change enables proper Python syntax highlighting for Jupyter notebook users who commonly use `ipython` and `ipython3` language identifiers in their MyST code-cell directives, improving the editing experience in Neovim while preserving standard tree-sitter-markdown behavior for regular code blocks.
