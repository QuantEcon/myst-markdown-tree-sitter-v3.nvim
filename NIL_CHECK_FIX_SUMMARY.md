# Fix Summary for Issue #33

## Problem
Users were experiencing an intermittent error when running the `:MystRefresh` command:

```
Error executing vim.schedule lua callback: ...yst-markdown-tree-sitter.nvim/lua/myst-markdown/init.lua:308: attempt to index field 'active' (a nil value)
```

## Root Cause
The error occurred when `ts_highlight.active` was `nil` but the code attempted to access `ts_highlight.active[buf]`. This can happen in certain states of nvim-treesitter where the highlight module is loaded but not fully initialized.

The problematic code was in three locations:
- Line 125: `if ts_highlight.active[buf] then`
- Line 235: `ts_highlighter = ts_highlight.active[buf]`  
- Line 308: `local highlighter_active = ts_highlight.active[buf] ~= nil`

## Solution
Added proper nil checks before accessing `ts_highlight.active[buf]`:

1. **Line 125** (refresh_highlighting function):
   ```lua
   -- Before: if ts_highlight.active[buf] then
   -- After:  if ts_highlight.active and ts_highlight.active[buf] then
   ```

2. **Line 235** (debug_myst function):
   ```lua
   -- Before: ts_highlighter = ts_highlight.active[buf]
   -- After:  if ts_highlight.active then
   --           ts_highlighter = ts_highlight.active[buf]
   --         end
   ```

3. **Line 308** (MystRefresh command feedback):
   ```lua
   -- Before: local highlighter_active = ts_highlight.active[buf] ~= nil
   -- After:  local highlighter_active = ts_highlight.active and ts_highlight.active[buf] ~= nil
   ```

## Impact
- ✅ Fixes the `attempt to index field 'active' (a nil value)` error
- ✅ Maintains all existing functionality
- ✅ Handles edge cases where nvim-treesitter is partially initialized
- ✅ No breaking changes to the API

## Testing
The fix has been validated with:
- Static analysis to ensure all nil access patterns are fixed
- Syntax validation to ensure no regressions
- Functional validation that existing features continue to work
- Edge case testing for different nvim-treesitter states

## Files Modified
- `lua/myst-markdown/init.lua` - Added nil checks in three locations
- `test/test_nil_check_fix.lua` - Added comprehensive test for the fix
- `test/validate_nil_check_fix.sh` - Added validation script
