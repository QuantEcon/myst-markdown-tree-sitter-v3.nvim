# MyST Refresh Fix Demonstration

This file demonstrates the fix for the tree-sitter highlighting refresh issue.

## Problem Before Fix
When users ran `:MystStatus`, they would see:
```
=== MyST Status ===
Filetype: myst
✓ File detected as MyST
✗ Tree-sitter highlighting not active (use :MystRefresh)
✓ MyST content detected in buffer
==================
```

And when they ran `:MystRefresh`, it would claim success:
```
MyST highlighting refresh initiated...
Current filetype: myst
MyST highlighting refreshed - Tree-sitter highlighting refreshed
```

But the highlighting would still not work, and `:MystStatus` would still show "not active".

## Solution
The fix adds validation to ensure tree-sitter highlighting actually becomes active.

## MyST Code Cells to Test

```{code-cell} python
# This should be highlighted with MyST syntax
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2, 3]})
print(df)
```

```{code-cell} javascript
// JavaScript code cell
const data = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(data.map(x => x * 2));
```

## After Fix
Now `:MystRefresh` will report:
- If successful: "MyST highlighting refreshed successfully - Tree-sitter highlighting activated successfully"
- If failed: "MyST highlighting refresh failed - Tree-sitter highlighting failed to activate"
- Plus actual status: "Tree-sitter highlighter status: active" or "not active"

This provides accurate feedback about whether the refresh actually worked.
