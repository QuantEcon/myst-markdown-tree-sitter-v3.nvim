# Validation script for MyST highlighting fix
# This script demonstrates how to test the fix

echo "=== MyST Highlighting Fix Validation ==="
echo ""

echo "1. The fix addresses the following issues:"
echo "   - Intermittent MyST highlighting not working properly"
echo "   - :MystRefresh command not actually refreshing highlighting"
echo "   - Commands reporting success but highlighting not changing"
echo ""

echo "2. Key improvements made:"
echo "   ✓ Proper nvim-treesitter.highlight.detach/attach API usage"
echo "   ✓ Increased timing delays from 20ms to 50ms"
echo "   ✓ Better error handling with buffer validation"
echo "   ✓ Eliminated duplicate filetype detection conflicts"
echo "   ✓ Enhanced debugging capabilities"
echo "   ✓ Improved command feedback"
echo ""

echo "3. Files modified:"
echo "   - lua/myst-markdown/init.lua (main refresh logic)"
echo "   - ftdetect/myst.lua (timing improvement)"
echo ""

echo "4. Test files added:"
echo "   - test/test_improved_highlighting_fix.lua (validation script)"
echo "   - test/test_refresh_functionality.md (test MyST file)"
echo ""

echo "5. To test the fix in Neovim:"
echo "   a. Open test/test_refresh_functionality.md"
echo "   b. Run :MystDebug to see detailed status"
echo "   c. Run :MystRefresh to force refresh highlighting"
echo "   d. Run :MystEnable/:MystDisable to test manual controls"
echo ""

echo "6. Expected behavior:"
echo "   - MyST files should be reliably detected and highlighted"
echo "   - :MystRefresh should provide feedback and actually refresh"
echo "   - Highlighting should be consistent across file opens"
echo "   - No more intermittent highlighting issues"
