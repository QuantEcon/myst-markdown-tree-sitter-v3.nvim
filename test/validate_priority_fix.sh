# Validation script for priority-based highlighting fix
# This script provides instructions for testing the fix

echo "=== Priority-based Highlighting Fix Validation ==="
echo ""

echo "1. The fix addresses the following issues:"
echo "   - Intermittent MyST highlighting not working properly"
echo "   - Complex race condition logic that didn't solve the core problem"
echo "   - Over-engineered retry and validation mechanisms"
echo ""

echo "2. Key improvements made:"
echo "   ✓ Replaced complex race condition logic with priority-based highlighting"
echo "   ✓ Reduced code by 603 lines, added only 58 lines"
echo "   ✓ Uses vim.api.nvim_set_hl() with priority = 110"
echo "   ✓ Links to 'Special' highlight for color scheme compatibility"
echo "   ✓ Simplified refresh function without retry loops"
echo "   ✓ Reduced timing delays from 150ms back to 50ms"
echo ""

echo "3. Files modified:"
echo "   - lua/myst-markdown/init.lua (massively simplified)"
echo "   - ftdetect/myst.lua (reverted timing changes)"
echo "   - Removed RACE_CONDITION_FIX.md and related test files"
echo ""

echo "4. New test files added:"
echo "   - test/test_priority_highlighting.lua (validation script)"
echo "   - test/test_priority_approach.md (test MyST file)"
echo "   - PRIORITY_HIGHLIGHTING_FIX.md (documentation)"
echo ""

echo "5. To test the fix in Neovim:"
echo "   a. Open test/test_priority_approach.md"
echo "   b. Check that {code-cell} directives are highlighted with Special color"
echo "   c. Run :MystDebug to see simplified status"
echo "   d. Run :MystRefresh to test simplified refresh"
echo "   e. Run :MystEnable/:MystDisable to test manual controls"
echo ""

echo "6. Expected behavior:"
echo "   - MyST directives highlighted with priority = 110 (higher than markdown)"
echo "   - No complex timing dependencies or retry mechanisms"
echo "   - Consistent highlighting through priority system"
echo "   - Simpler, more maintainable code"

echo ""
echo "7. Priority-based highlighting works by:"
echo "   - Setting MyST highlights with priority = 110"
echo "   - This overrides default markdown highlights (lower priority)"
echo "   - No need for complex timing or race condition workarounds"
